# MAGENTO 2 ADMIN PAYMENT METHOD

Currently, Magento 2 default does not activate a payment method for admin use only. In many cases, you will wish to have a payment method that you could assign to a backend order only and invisible on the checkout page in the frontend. For instance, sometimes, customers would like to make orders by phone or pay by money transfer or in-person cash. Therefore, [Magento 2 Admin Payment Method](https://bsscommerce.com/magento-2-admin-payment-method-extension.html) enables you to create orders from the backend and use the payment method visible at the backend only.
